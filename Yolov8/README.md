# CougarAI YOLOv8 Workshop Series

## Overview

This workshop is part (3/4), where the first 2 went over OpenCV, and how different models are trained. This workshop goes over using the YOLOv8 base model (no training), and then moves onto training YOLO to detect desired objects. 

The point of this workshop is to learn to use the base YOLO model, and if needed train YOLO on objects of interest. This workshop also goes into annotating images for training, the unannotated images used in this workshop can be used for practice and found in the practice folder.

Going in order:
1. Intro_to_YOLOv8.ipynb
2. ObjectDetection
3. ActionDetection
